Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience, without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.

Deep Learning, a further subset of machine learning, uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn representations of data. These deep neural networks have revolutionized fields such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an area of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. NLP enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval with generative AI. RAG systems retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base and use it to augment the context for a language model, resulting in more accurate and grounded responses.

Vector databases are specialized databases designed to store and query high-dimensional vectors efficiently. They are essential for semantic search applications, where documents and queries are converted into vector embeddings that capture their semantic meaning.

Embeddings are numerical representations of text, images, or other data types in a high-dimensional vector space. Similar items have similar embeddings, allowing for semantic similarity search and clustering.
